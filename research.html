			<h3>Number.1 - Maps</h3>
			<!--Link set on the image of the website that was taken as a reference-->
			<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/adding-a-google-map" target="_blank"><img src="images/ref1.jpg" class="i" style="float: left;"></a>
			<img src="images/ref1c.jpg" class="i" style="float: right;">

				The idea of keeping a map in my website was influenced from the google maps. So, inorder to keep it in my page, the developers google page was accessed which also showed how to keep the map in a web page. Although they look similar, there are some differences. The map in my webpage has its location fixed at Islington College and the border radius is also kept at 10px. Also the height and the width are also quite different from the other one.

			<h3>Number.2 - Form</h3>
			<!--Link set on the image of the website that was taken as a reference-->

			<img src="images/ref2c.jpg" class="i" style="float: right;">
			<p class="p">
				The idea of form was generated by the testimonial request of the jotform page. Although the two forms look quite different, they also have some similarities. The left webpage has name and two boxes in the same line for first name and last name . Whereas in my website, there is first name as well as last name and the boxes are just below it. The gender and the radio button were added extra. The email section is almost same. And on the left webpage, there is combo box for work done whereas in my webpage the combo box is to choose which country the viewer is from. Just below it is the testimonial in the left webpage, wheras in my webpage, it is the message and both of it uses a text area. All of the boxes in my webpage have a placeholder and the border radius is slightly rounded. And finally there is a send button in my webpage then it goes under some javascript function and displays appropriate message under the given condition.

			<img src="images/ref3c.jpg" class="i" style="float: right;">
			<p class="p">
				The buttons in the home page of the left page was taken as a reference for the buttons kept in my home page. The overall design is also looks somehow similar. There are some similarities as well as differences in the buttons of the left webpage. There are only two buttons in the left web page whereas in my page there are three buttons. The buttons in the left webpage are more rounded whereas the buttons in my webpage are less rounded. The button in the left webpage has used an active hover whereas it isn't used in my page. The on hover transition and effect are also different compared to each other. A grey background drops in my buttons whereas in the left web page it's just plain white. However both of it has its link to a particular webpage displayed in the button.  	</p>

			<h3>Number.4 - Image Slider</h3>

			<p class="p">
				The idea of keeping a image slider had struck by the hotel website. Whenever we needed to book a hotel, the image used to keep sliding. So, the hotel portland's website was taken as a reference for it. Both the image slider looks quite similar. The image slider in my page doesn't use a button whereas the hotel one uses button as well but also slides continuosly without the button. The image is quite bigger in the hotel one whereas the one in my page is comparitively smaller and a bit rounded. The similarities is that both of the images continously changes without doing anything every 1.5 second.

			<img src="images/ref5c.jpg" class="i" style="float: right;">
			<p class="p">
				The navigation bar was referred from the w3 schools website. The nav bar between both the page is quite similar. Both the nav bar uses a active tag on which they're on. Both the nav bar has links to go to the given page. However the color are different. The fonts are also different. The nav bar in my page is kept at the right side whereas in the w3 schools it is shown at the left side. The background is greyish black in w3 school whereas it is transparent in my page.
